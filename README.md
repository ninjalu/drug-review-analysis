# drug-review-analysis
## I. Data information
The data is obtained through [UCI website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29)

The dataset provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10 star patient rating reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. The intention was to study 

1. sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, i.e. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects, 
2. the transferability of models among domains, i.e. conditions, and 
3. the transferability of models among different data sources (see 'Drug Review Dataset (Druglib.com)'). 

The data is split into a train (75%) a test (25%) partition (see publication) and stored in two .tsv (tab-separated-values) files, respectively.

1. drugName (categorical): name of drug
