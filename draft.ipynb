Suboxone is actually working well to help get my life back in order.

He thought I was depressed before, now I don&#039;t want to even leave the house. DOCTORS OVER PRESCRIBE!!!!!

I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free.

I had very bad plaque psoriasis covering almost every part of my body and guttate psoriasis mainly on my wrists, arms, and back. It was painful when the lesions on my shins would crack and bleed. I&#039;ve tried almost every cream/spray but those only temporary relieved them. But ever since I started Humira 2 months ago the plaque went away, my scalp psoriasis is gone, guttate psoriasis is clearing, and overall no more itching, flaking, cracking, and bleeding! The only side effects, if they are even caused by this medication is that I&#039;ve been getting acne.\"\n",

But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\r\n",

About 5 doctors were afraid of giving me anything stronger than regular Vicoden because of habit forming. Who cared if I couldn&#039;t walk or participate in activities. I finally found a doctor that was willing to help! Sometimes they give dogs more pallative care than humans. I should have gone to a vetenerian instead. \"\n",

      "\"I started taking Midodrine early last year and like others before me have said...it&#039;s the best thing since sliced bread! I had to get out of the military because of bradycardia and vaso-vagal syncope and I was taking fludrocortisone at the time. The Florinef was awful, my hair was falling out, my nails were tissue paper thin (and painful), and I was still passing out every time I stood up. Midodrine has allowed me to do the things I love! I am a serious bowler (trying to go pro) and without this awesome stuff. I wouldn&#039;t be able to bowl more than one game (and very slowly) without passing out. I can also take showers STANDING UP! *GASP!!!* What a concept! It&#039;s a lovely medication! My only quabble is the tingling on my head.\"\n",
      "\"I just got my results of my first blood test after being on Livalo for two months. My total cholesterol was 189, and my good cholesterol was 60. Very happy with the results as my cholesterol hovered around 240 for the past 20 years. I had tried Crestor and Pravachol with bad muscle aches. My doctor finally talked me in to trying another Statin, since she said Livalo was better tolerated. So far, so good!\"\n",
      "\"Suboxone has completely turned my life around.  I feel healthier, I&#039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin.\"\n",

I had to buy a new generic p, at 10 times the price. The new generic was not working to lower blood pressure. My doctor said I needed to take 60mg. When I got my dose up to 40mg, I then noticed my blood pressure was starting to come down some. At 40mg I developed whole body shaking that continued in all waking hours. Every time I either reduce my dose to 15mg or stop taking it, the whole body tremor stops. My last doctor says it is not the propranolol, that it is my thyroid meds. I have been on same thyroid meds since 2012 and never got this shaking prior to this new generic propranolol.\"\n"

      "Awful medicine, the worst. The side effects outweigh the benefit.  Headache the first night, leg and back pain, Sensitive skin,  just awful. Pain got worse and worse. I changed my meds to ciproflaxcin. I have used this in the past so hopefully, it will continue to help. I even questioned the doc at urgent care to see if I can take cipro and she offered macrobid. Maybe this urgent care and this medication is something they get a deal on....stay away from macrobid.\n",
      "I'm 27 and I have been using Drysol since I was 21.  I found deodorants and antiperspirants did not work for me.  I have never been a heavy sweater but when I would wear them the combination of my sweat and the products would be a weird soapy smell.  I used Drysol at first once a week (using it 2 nights in a row gave me an armpit rash which hurt) but I used it when I needed *if I smelled and was sweating I would use it again that night*  I find the next night after using it my armpits are a little itchy, but I have nothing to say but good things about Drysol.  6 years later I don't even remember the last time I used it (maybe months ago) I have saved money on ruined shirts from pit stains and I don't ever smell. Strongly recommended!\n",
      "So I've actually had this implant since I've been 15, and I'm by 18. When I first had it put in, I bled and spotted for 6 months, which I was warned would happen. After that my cycle was very irregular, either every couple weeks or couple months or even 4-5 months without. It is sometimes worrying going so long without one, because I always wonder if there's something else wrong. But I have to say I love the implant, it's super effective. I get no cramps or mood swings and my cycles are very light and last 2-4 days at most.  I would definitely recommend this.\n",
      "I've been on Latuda for a little under 2 and a half years. It almost completely stopped my psychotic symptoms except I still hear voices now and then, mainly when I try to go to sleep, but there are no delusions or paranoia while on the drug. I take cogentin in combination with it because it causes me to shake a lot. Main side effects I experience include anhedonia, shakiness, jaw clenching, and inability to sit still. However, I'm happy with it because it actually works, while other antipsychotic meds I tried did not, and it doesn't cause the endless hunger that I experienced with drugs like Saphris, Haldol, Zyprexa, and Risperdal. It should be noted I am at the max daily dose, which is 160mg.\n",

The application felt like a regular Pap smear at first and it lasted about 30 seconds, I was surprised when he said he was done. It was painful but bearable, I felt 3 extremely severe cramps and it was over after that. I've had cramps for the past 2 days, and they're nothing like the minor cramps I used to experience with my regular period. Loss of appetite and moody because of the cramps but it's not that bad.\n",

They are both in high school and doing well.\n",
      "This cream is absolutely horrible. I will admit the cream initially does what is says it will do, gets rid of the redness. However this is completely temporary, around 6 hours in my experience. What comes afterward is a serious rebound. I spent the day outside in the cold weather (normally a trigger for me, which would normally warrant redness) and when I came back in around 6 hours later my face has never felt hotter in my life. My skin burned and was unbelievably deep red, it looked as if I had held my face up against a fire. This lasted around 2-3 hours. I used it once more thinking my skin needed to get used to it and the results were even worse. I threw away all of my samples after 2 days.\n",

Now, even previous to these trials and tribulations, I've always been a fairly anxious person. I learned to cope with my \"issues\" through prayer, yoga, books....things of that nature but this last blow of the accident sent some place else. I finally realized I needed help. I'm only on day 2. I feel better but drowsy. I'm hoping this will at least stabilize me once again. (fingers crossed)\n",
